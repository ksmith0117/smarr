                <p>
                    Smarr Garage Door, Inc. was established in 1979 by Dale Smarr. Over the last 35 years, Dale has grown this business
                    from a one man operation to the multi-truck company we are today, servicing most of central Missouri. In late 2014, the Company
                    successfully transitioned to new ownership, Cade and Katie Smith. We plan to build on the foundation that Dale laid, and
                    continue the growth of this Company by implementing Customer-centric policies, and creating processes to achieve outstanding results
                    on every job.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our mission is to provide high quality products and service to our residential and commercial Customers in central Missouri to drive
                    Customer Satisfaction. We will do this through operational excellence, the Baldrige Criteria for
                    Performance Excellence, and strong branding position.
